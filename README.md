# Simple ESNtest for future Web Developers or for playing a bit

The purpose of this repository is to test the skills of our future
developers or our current ITcom members and see how they solve some
basic html and php task, how they manage to face the code by reading
the provided documentation and existing functions and evaluate their
coding skills and use of coding standards (we follow Drupal standards).
If you want to test it, you can fork it to your own github.

After forking it, clone it into your dev environment and initialize it;
loading the index page in your browser will reveal the rest of the instructions.
