          <li>Using the bootstrap <strong>Card component</strong>, render a previsualisation of the last three articles availables form the list.</li>

          <li>The previsualisation must contain the title, the date, the first 250 chars of the article followed by '...' (or just the full article if the lenght is less), and a 'Go to the article' link (use '#' instead of a real URL).</li>

      <div class="task">The class file <code>src/TestController.php</code> needs to be finished, as well the respective block in the twig file.</div>
      <div class="task">As you can see, that class extends an existing class, but is almost empty except for a function that returns, for now, an empty array.</div>
      <div class="task">The extended class is in charge of fetching information belonging to ESN (countries, sections, etc.) from an API (but the returned data is a bit messy, and in several endpoints), and we want to show this information in a nice way by using again the <strong>Card component</strong> and extending its behaviour to create and structure that uses the accordion format, as Bootstrap offers.</div>
      <div class="task"><em>This accordion must contain one ESN country per group item (header) and inside the panel of this group item, all of the sections belonging to this country. In the header it must appear the flag and name of the country and the number of the sections belonging to it (leaving the style of this up to the user). The list of ESN sections that belongs to that country needs to be placed inside the panel. All the panes must be collapsibles and must stay closed the moment the accordion is firstly rendered.</em></div>
      <div class="task"><strong>The main tasks are:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>To complete the <code>getData()</code> function, returning what is needed to build the required accordion.</li>
          <li>To finish the <code>solution_accordion</code> twig block in the file <code>templates/blocks_front.twig</code> using the returned value of the previous functions in the format of the mentioned accordion.</li>
          <li>There are multiple solutions to this approach, use the one that is easier for you.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="task"><em>The optional subtasks are:</em>
        <ul>
          <li>If the section have a website, show it by using the proper font-awesome icon and opening it in a new page just after the code.</li>
          <li>Sort the list by country name and/or by section name too.</li>

      <div class="task"><strong>The main tasks are:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a new class inside the <code>src/Views</code> folder.</li>

        <div><strong>Some hints:</strong></div>
        <div>The name you choose for the class does not matter, as the class will load automatically. Check the other classes in the <code>Views</code> folder to see how the functions are declared, as might be important. You dont need to create new controllers for this task, as all the needed ones are already created; you can use them. Parameters are passed automatically to the functions and available in the declaration of your function, matching what is written in the uri.</div>

        <div>
          It might happen that the route you have set does not load automatically (and you get a 404).
          Is because the PHP cache. Might take a few secs to work.
          If not, you can refresh the browser cache or try with anonymouse session.
